Don't be a shitty listener. Pay the fuck attention when people talk to you. It shows you give a damn and helps you understand others better.
Embrace your fucking failures. They're just life lessons in disguise, so learn from them and grow some thick skin.
Stop giving a fuck about what others think. It's your life, not theirs. Do what makes you happy and let the haters hate.
Set some fucking goals. You need direction in your life, or you'll end up wandering aimlessly like a dumbass.
Learn to say "no" like a boss. You're not a goddamn doormat, so don't let people walk all over you.
Cut out the toxic shit. If someone's bringing you down, it's time to kick their ass to the curb and surround yourself with positive motherfuckers.
Take care of your fucking mental health. It's just as important as your physical health, so get your head straight and seek help if you need it.
Own your goddamn mistakes. Nobody's perfect, so admit when you're wrong and move the fuck on.
Stop comparing your life to others' highlight reels. Social media is a load of bullshit, so focus on your own journey and progress.
Practice fucking gratitude. It's easy to get caught up in the negatives, but remembering what you're grateful for can help keep your head out of your ass.
