Don't be a shitty listener. Pay the fuck attention when people talk to you. It shows you give a damn and helps you understand others better.
Embrace your fucking failures. They're just life lessons in disguise, so learn from them and grow some thick skin.
Stop giving a fuck about what others think. It's your life, not theirs. Do what makes you happy and let the haters hate.
Set some fucking goals. You need direction in your life, or you'll end up wandering aimlessly like a dumbass.
Learn to say "no" like a boss. You're not a goddamn doormat, so don't let people walk all over you.
Cut out the toxic shit. If someone's bringing you down, it's time to kick their ass to the curb and surround yourself with positive motherfuckers.
Take care of your fucking mental health. It's just as important as your physical health, so get your head straight and seek help if you need it.
Own your goddamn mistakes. Nobody's perfect, so admit when you're wrong and move the fuck on.
Stop comparing your life to others' highlight reels. Social media is a load of bullshit, so focus on your own journey and progress.
Practice fucking gratitude. It's easy to get caught up in the negatives, but remembering what you're grateful for can help keep your head out of your ass.
Don't be a lazy fuck. Procrastination gets you nowhere. If you want to achieve something, get off your ass and put in the work.
Learn to fucking adapt. Shit happens, and life throws curveballs. Roll with the punches and make the best of whatever comes your way.
Stop overthinking every goddamn thing. Analysis paralysis is real, and it'll keep you stuck in a rut if you let it.
Keep your fucking ego in check. Confidence is great, but arrogance makes you a prick. Be humble and know your limits.
Be a relentless motherfucker when it comes to self-improvement. There's always room to grow, so keep pushing yourself and never settle.
Embrace fucking change. It's inevitable, so don't waste your time resisting it. Adapt and grow, or you'll be left behind.
Learn to fucking communicate. Express your thoughts and feelings like an adult, not a whiny little bitch.
Stop blaming others for your shit. Take responsibility for your actions and own up to your part in any situation.
Don't let fear hold you back. Scared shitless? Do it anyway. Courage is feeling the fear and doing it regardless.
Don't take life too fucking seriously. It's important to have goals and ambition, but remember to let loose and have fun once in a while.
